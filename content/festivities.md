### Be Sure to Read

1. Our wedding will be held on a public golf course. This means people will actually be playing golf during our wedding and walking around doing their own thing. Don’t be alarmed! However, be courteous to others and know we are all sharing this beautiful Napa venue.

2. Our wedding is the weekend of Cinco de Mayo, also known to many people as an excuse to drink tequila during the day. Napa gets very packed during the weekend and especially since May 5th is a Saturday, the town will mostly likely be even more crowded than usual. This means it’s a good idea to book your hotel early and plan your travel accordingly.
