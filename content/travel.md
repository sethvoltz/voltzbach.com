# Travel & Accommodations

We recommend booking your travel ASAP. Napa is extremely crowded during the month of May and Cinco de Mayo is the weekend of our wedding. Below are our suggestions:

## Transportation

For those out of town guests, here are some suggestions:

Drive if you live within 4 hours, as the closest major airports are still about an hour away.

Those further away, look into flying into **Oakland International Airport (OAK)** or **San Francisco International Airport (SFO)**

**Oakland or SF > Napa**

Car rentals:

[Kayak Rentals for SF](https://www.kayak.com/Cheap-San-Francisco-Car-Rentals.13852.cars.ksp)

Buses:

[San Francisco Buses](https://www.wanderu.com/en/depart/SanFrancisco)

Very expensive, but last resort: Lyft or Uber â€“ these are great for getting around once in Napa.
