# Wedding Party

## Jamie Schwarzbach, Bride

Grew up in Northridge, CA, where she excelled in chemistry and sports (what a great combo, huh?). Received a partial scholarship for track and field at UCSB, in Santa Barbara, where she received her BS in chemistry. She then attended graduate school at the University of Nevada Reno, studying organic chemistry. She enjoyed joining the Nevada Cycling Team, where she competed in mountain biking. All the while she graduated with her MS in chemistry and MBA. After moving to SF with her soon to be hubby, she’s mainly worked in life science companies in marketing and project management. Her favorite things: Snowboarding, biking, yoga, her two cats, looking at expensive real estate online, and anything chocolate.

## Seth Voltz, Groom

Born on Martha’s Vineyard and raised in New Durham, NH. He was very computer savvy at a young age, so he went to Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) where he studied computer science. There he met a few friends and started a company focused on tech stuff. This and a second startup moved him out to California, where he lived in San Francisco and San Jose. He moved to Reno for his startup company, where he met Jamie at a local bar. There, they hit it off discussing computers and chemistry. They soon moved to SF together when he started working for a company in Silicon Valley. His favorite things: Programming, electronics, marking things, coffee, his two cats, watching woodworking videos, and #homemadecocktails.
