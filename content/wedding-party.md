## Jamie Schwarzbach, Bride

Grew up in Northridge, CA, where she excelled in chemistry and sports (what a great combo, huh?). She decided to attend UCSB because of her partial track and field scholarship, in Santa Barbara, where she graduated with her BS in chemistry. She then attended graduate school at the University of Nevada Reno, studying organic chemistry. She enjoyed joining the Nevada Cycling Team, where she competed in mountain biking. All the while, she graduated with her MS in chemistry and MBA. After moving to SF with her soon to be hubby, she’s mainly worked in life sciences companies focusing on marketing and project management. Her favorite things: Snowboarding, biking, yoga, her two cats, looking at expensive real estate online, and anything with chocolate.

## Seth Voltz, Groom

Born on Martha’s Vineyard and raised in New Durham, NH. He was very computer savvy at a young age, so he attended Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and studied computer science. There, he met a few friends and started a company focused on tech stuff. This and a second startup company moved him out to California, where he lived in San Francisco and San Jose. He moved to Reno for his startup company, where he met Jamie at a local bar. There, they hit it off discussing computers and chemistry. They soon moved to SF together where he started working for a company in Silicon Valley. His favorite things: Programming, electronics, making things, coffee, his two cats, watching woodworking videos, and #homemadecocktails.
